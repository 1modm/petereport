## {% translate "Restricted Use Warning" %}

This report was prepared by **{{md_author}}** at the request of **{{DB_report_query.product.customer.name}}** to whom it is delivered.
Any other use is strictly prohibited.

Any communication, publication, disclosure, dissemination or reproduction of this report or any portion of its contents
to third parties without the advance written consent of **{{md_author}}** is not authorized.

## {% translate "Context" %}

**{{md_author}}** were engaged by **{{DB_report_query.product.customer.name}}** to perform a pentest against **{{DB_report_query.product.name}}** part in a way
that would cover major areas of security controls.
The {{md_author}} assessment highlights vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker in order to compromise
the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system and applications.

{{md_author}} Consultants worked from {{DB_report_query.audit_start|date:"Y-m-d" }} until {{DB_report_query.audit_end|date:"Y-m-d" }} from {{md_author}} Site ({{md_address}}).

This mission must lead to:

- GreyBox Pentest results,

- Recommendations to improve the level of security.

## {% translate "Scope and Objectives" %}

The objective of this security assessment was for **{{DB_report_query.product.customer.name}}** to understand
the current IT risk profile for their external services and to provide recommendations to help reduce these risks.
The exercise was designed to replicate the activities of a threat actor with the intention of gaining access to **{{DB_report_query.product.name}}**
in order to either disrupt the production, steal information or cause damage.

This work was performed based on OWASP Top 10 attacks and {{md_author}} experience.
The table below specify the list major attacks performed against the application :

|Attacks vectors|
| --- |
|Injection|
|Broken Authentication|
|Sensitive data exposure|
|XML External Entities (XXE)|
|Broken Access control|
|Security misconfigurations|
|Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)|
|Insecure Deserialization|
|Using Components with known vulnerabilities|
|Insufficient logging and monitoring|

Other attack vectors were tested by the {{md_author}} to cover system, infrastructure and API.

## {% translate "General Limitations" %}

This assessment was based on limited observation and/or testing at a single point in time.
Over time as systems, environments, people and other parameters are subject to change, there is a risk that this report will not represent the current state.

The information gathered is subject to inherent limitations, therefore weaknesses,
errors or irregularities which may have been present at the time of the audit may not have been detected.
Identification of all existing vulnerabilities cannot be guaranteed.
{{md_author}} cannot estate that assets within the scope of work are free of weaknesses or immune to attacks.
